#Semester2Labs

I received postive reveiews for the Regression analysis refresher kit repo, last semester. Since I'll be conducting labs for three different
courses this semester, I thought it best to use the **github wiki** interface to write notes about the labs each week. 
This repository will also be used to store all the relevant code for all semester 2 labs I m conducting, as well.
